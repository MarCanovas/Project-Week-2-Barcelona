## Project Description
Our project goal is to analyse the available data related to pollution and air quality from the city of Barcelona in November 2017. We will check for relations between times, values, stations and air quality in order to obtain some insights from the dataset.


## Questions & Hypotheses

### Questions:
- What gas proportion determines a good air quality?
- Which zones have a better air quality?
- At what time of day is air quality better?

### Hypotheses:
- If the station is located inside a green area, air quality is better.
- Air quality is better at night.

## Dataset
Urban environment: 
- air-quality-nov-2017 
- air-stations-nov-2017
